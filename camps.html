          <h1>Summer Overnight Camp</h1>
          <p>The one-week overnight camp is for children ages 6 to 13 years old who have had or are currently dealing with cancer or other blood-related disorders.  The goal is to put the disease aside for a short while and encourage each camper’s inner child to come out and play, enjoying a “normal” camping experience, regardless of their illness or the side effects of their treatments<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">.
					<br>  					<br>

					Overnight Camp: Held at Babler State Park’s Outdoor Education Center,  is a treasured week, enjoyed in the fresh air and sunshine, free from the confines of hospital walls.   The Camp Rainbow team is composed of high-school age counselors, college-age unit heads, and an adult staff, including a full medical team.  Counselors work with campers on a one to one or one to two ratio, depending on the age group.
					<br>  					<br>

					Daily camp activities include archery, arts and crafts, drama, a low ropes challenge course, fishing, music, nature, sports, and swimming.  Afternoons are filled with exciting choice activities such as photography, cooking, magic, pottery, or jewelry making.  With a special theme each day, such as Western Day, Superhero Day, and Circus Day, it is no surprise to see campers, counselors, and staff in full costume. Every day a broad range of enthusiastic guests such as magicians, clowns, firefighters, police, and professional athletes visit camp to join in the fun.
					<br>  					<br>

					For one magical week each summer, Overnight Camp strives to create an environment where the campers are not burdened by their illness but rather empowered to deal with all of life’s challenges, all while having fun and “just being a kid”.

					<br>  					<br>

					Summer overnight camp is held at Babler State Park's Outdoor Education Center in Wildwood, Missouri.

          <h1>Summer Day Camp</h1>
          <p>Beginning in June, 1997, we added the one-week day camp for 4 to 6 years olds which is held during the same week as overnight camp from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The camp is specifically designed to meet  the unique needs of younger children who are battling cancer or blood related disorders. While they may not yet be ready for a week-long overnight stay, our eager 4, 5 and 6-year-olds still benefit from the fun and excitement of a typical week at camp<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">.

					<br>  <br>
					Day Camp is held at the same location as Overnight Camp. An experienced Camp Director and dedicated young adult staff oversee these active and creative youngsters, giving constant, nearly one-on-one attention to each camper.  A full medical staff is always on hand for immediate as well as ongoing medical needs.
					<br>  					<br>

					Campers participate in age-appropriate activities such as arts and crafts, drama, music, nature exploration, sports, swimming, and much more. They follow the daily themes of the Overnight Camp and integrate these themes into many of their activities. Embracing the opportunity to be “kids” and not “patients”, our youngest campers really enjoy the special visitors each day, especially the clowns, magicians, and the firefighters with their hook-and-ladder trucks!
					<br>  					<br>

					As with the Overnight Camp, our most important consideration is always the health and well-being of our youngest campers. We feel it is the perfect introduction to Overnight Camp for the little ones, most of who leave Day Camp excited to return the following summer for the sleepover camp!
					<br>  					<br>

					For one magical week each summer, Overnight Camp strives to create an environment where the campers are not burdened by their illness but rather empowered to deal with all of life’s challenges, all while having fun and “just being a kid”.

          <h1>Siblings Camp</h1>
          <p>This is the camp for the super important brothers and sisters! Siblings of children diagnosed with cancer also experience a strong emotional and social impact. Oftentimes, siblings feel overlooked as the parents and other family members turn their attention to treatment and other considerations that coincide with a cancer diagnosis. Just as the child with cancer needs support, attention and care, so do their strongest supporters — their brothers and sisters<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">.
					<br>  <br>
					Camp Rainbow SIBS Camp is a one-week overnight camp for children ages 7 to 17 years old who have had or are currently dealing with a sibling's diagnosis of cancer or other blood-related disorders.  Held at Camp Manitowa,  SIBS camp is a treasured week for approximately 100 siblings. The Camp Rainbow team is composed of college-age guides and adult staff, many of whom are SIBS themselves!
					<br>  <br>

					Like our overnight summer camp, daily camp activities include archery, arts and crafts, drama, a low ropes challenge course, fishing, music, nature, sports, and swimming.  Afternoons are filled with exciting choice activities such as photography, cooking, magic, pottery, or jewelry making.
					<br>  <br>

					During this one magical week each summer, SIBS Camp strives to create an environment where the campers are empowered to deal with all of life’s challenges, all while having fun and “just being a kid”.

					SIBS Camp is held at Camp Manitowa Cedar Pointe in Makanda, Illinois.

          <h1>Family Camp</h1>
          <p> is a place for kids with cancer and their families to have fun and enjoy a camp experience in a safe atmosphere. Held annually at Trout Lodge in Potosi, Missouri over Labor Day Weekend, this camp provides the whole family with the opportunity to bond and share feelings, but most importantly to let loose and have fun. Families participate in a variety of activities which include exploring the outdoors, arts and crafts, horseback riding, archery, boating, magic shows, and much more<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">.
					<br>	<br>

					Like all other Camp Rainbow Programs, Family Camp will provide the special medical expertise and close monitoring required for children with cancer. Medical personnel are available around-the-clock to administer routine chemotherapy, arrange for blood counts, handle any medical emergencies, and adjust any programs to the camper’s individual needs.  The Camp is staffed by volunteers who are carefully selected to ensure the safety of all campers. Staff members include physicians, oncology nurses, pediatric oncology social workers, teachers, cancer survivors, and past camp families.

          <p> Camp Rainbow can be felt anywhere….out in the sunshine, or even on the floors of the hospital.  Wherever smiles are needed, that’s where the rainbow goes! Camp-In is an inpatient activity, aimed at providing a 2-day camp experience for children who are inpatient at the 3 area hospitals – St. Louis Children’s Hospital, Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital, and Mercy Medical Center<span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5">.

					Held several times throughout the year, Camp-In brings activities and excitement not only to the Oncology floors but to the outpatient clinics as well. Run by our camp volunteers, parents and selected hospital staff, Camp-In brings many of the typical camp activities right to the patients, including arts and crafts, music and games. If siblings happen to be visiting, they are always welcome to join in the fun. Every participant receives a camp bag filled with goodies and Camp Rainbow memorabilia </span></p>

          <h1>Teen Camp</h1>
          <p>Camp Rainbow Teen Camp is a unique weekend-long overnight camping experience for high school teens ages 14 to 18 facing cancer or blood related disorders. Held at Babler State Park’s Outdoor Education Center in March, special themes for the weekend deal with communication, relationships, and self-esteem. Throughout the weekend, the teens participate in activities such as bowling, ropes courses, nature hikes, games, movies, arts and crafts, a social action project and more. Assuming more of a leadership role in the activities builds their confidence and inner strength – skills that will serve these teens well as they face not only their illness but life outside their diagnosis as well<span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6">.
						<br>	<br>
					Starting in 2017, the Camp Rainbow Teens-N-Twenty (TnT) Program started that provides social opportunities for our teen campers to remain connected throughout the year.  Half and full day social events are held each quarter for teens ages 14-20 years old.  Details and calendar will be released through eblasts, flyers distributed at camp and by hospital social workers, as well as on our social media outlets.
					<br>	<br>
					The weekend long overnight camp is held at Babler State Park in Wildwood, Missouri. The TnT Program is held throughout the year at various locations.
