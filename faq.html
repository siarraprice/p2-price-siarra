          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>Camp Rainbow consists of a week-long overnight camp for kids from the ages of 6 to 13 who have had or are currently in treatment for cancer or other blood disorders. Camp Rainbow also holds a Day Camp for children ages 4 to 6 that runs concurrently with camp, as well as a Teen Camp for high school aged campers that runs for a weekend in March. Camp Rainbow draws its participants from the three major Pediatric Oncology departments in the St. Louis area: Cardinal Glennon, St. Louis Children’s Hospital, and Mercy Hospital.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>The Camp Rainbow Foundation office is located in Chesterfield, Missouri on Olive Blvd. Overnight Summer Camp, Mini Day Camp and Teen camp are held at the Outdoor Education Center at Babler State Park in Wildwood, MO, about half an hour from the city of St. Louis. Family Camp is held at Trout Lodge in Potosi, MO.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>Thanks to the generosity of so many sponsors and donors, Camp Rainbow continues to be free for all of the campers who attend.</p>

            <span class="toggle-indicator">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>The counselors at Camp Rainbow are a carefully selected group of high school and college age students; they are supervised by well-trained senior staff.  Many of our counselors are young adults who have lived through or currently live with cancer or another blood related disorder themselves. Many of these counselors were campers at some point in time. Counselors go through an intense orientation and training program, and work on a one-to-one or a one-to-two basis with the campers, depending upon the age and current health of the camper. All staff 18 years of age and older go through a background check.</p>

          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>Yes. Camp Rainbow has a full staff of nurses who are in attendance during our camp programs to administer expert medical treatment. The nurses, who volunteer their time to be at camp, facilitate all of the day-to-day medical needs of the campers. We also have a Pediatric/Oncology doctor that works with us during the week of Summer Camp and a Hematology doctor that works with us during Family Camp. If necessary, your child will be able to leave for treatment at the hospital and then return to camp.<br>  <br>Daily protective precautions are taken as well – waterproof sunscreen and insect repellent are available at all times and are a mandatory part of the day’s routine.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>Camp Rainbow has all of the activities of a standard summer camp. These activities include, but are not limited to, swimming, fishing, archery, arts and crafts, drama, sports, nature, and a low ropes challenge course. There are also “camper choice” activities each afternoon and special evening programming each night.</p>

            <h5>How does my child get to camp?</h5>
            <span class="toggle-indicator">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>Campers typically arrive at Babler State Park camp by a family member or friend of the family. However, if transportation is needed for your child Camp Rainbow will work with you directly to ensure your child can arrive safely to camp.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="accordion-headers">
            <h5>How do I apply for Camp?</h5>
            <span class="toggle-indicator">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>To inquire about having your child attend one of the three camps held at Babler State Park please contact your hospital. All applications received are discussed with your hospital contact prior to determining eligibility to attend.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="accordion-headers">
            <h5>Can I contact my camper during overnight summer camp?</h5>
            <span class="toggle-indicator">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>Unless there is an emergency we do not allow direct contact with the camper. Camp offers children the opportunity to play and have fun and contact with family members can often lead to homesickness or the inability to let go and enjoy oneself fully. Of course if there is a problem at camp, parents (and/or guardians) are notified immediately.<br>  <br>We do have the ability for you to view pictures on our website during the week of Summer Camp and Day Camp as well as send one-way emails that we will deliver to your camper. Campers can not send return emails.</p>

            <h5>Can I volunteer at Camp Rainbow?</h5>
            <span class="toggle-indicator">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-description">
            <p>Camp Rainbow is always looking for volunteers. Due to space and logistics not every volunteer can be accommodated to work at our Summer Camp, Family Camp, or Teen Camp. However, all year long we have need for volunteers to help with the administrative tasks of keeping Camp Rainbow thriving and successful.</p>
