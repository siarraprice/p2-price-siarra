This was a difficult assignment that tested my knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

The part I had most difficulties with was the navigation. I wanted to have a navigation that was both mobile responsive (hamburger menu) and also had a submenu dropdown functinoality as well. I struggled with this and was able to get one functinality to work at a time, but not both at the same time. In the end, I opted to forgoe the dropdown submenu functionality. I used tutorials from W3-Schools, YouTube, and CodePen to get these to work.

I do like the way my navigation turned out. The slide in from the side is very nice.

The next challenge I had was the API. I struggled to find an API that I was imagining, and then worked hard to install it properly. I re-watched the module recordings on API installations and was able to figure it out after some trial and errors.
